\bigbreak\noindent This handbook was typeset in Würzburg\kern0.05em, Germany
with {Lua\LaTeX} in \emph{Kaius} by Lisa~Fischbach and \emph{Codelia} by Toshi~Omagari,
both of whom generously made adjustments to their fine work to accomodate the needs of this handbook.

\bigbreak\noindent Additional fonts in use are \emph{Lyon~Arabic} by Khajag~Apelian, Wael~Morcos, and Kai~Bernau;
\emph{Kaiti} by Zhang~Jiasheng\kern0.05em, Zhou~Huanbin, and Chen~Lütan;
and \emph{Choieongho} by Joachim~Müller-Lancé, Ku~Moa, and Choi~Jeongho.

\bigbreak\noindent Special thanks to Georg~Seifert for reviewing early versions of the plugin code,
providing insightful comments on the internals of the plugin, and
extending the Glyphs~API to make working with tags more convenient.
